# TradovateIndicators

This contains custom indicators I have made for specific items I need. Download the .js files and follow the install instructions. As tradovate has been abandon for support for ninjatrader, there is a bug with new drawings. When you click the visible eye to hide, it will not hide untill you go to a different tab and come back (refresh). No high hopes it will ever be fixed ..... like no brackets with group orders.

Feel free to download and use code how ever you see fit. 

## How to install 
1. Open the code editor
2. Click File, Import
3. Navigate to the downloaded .js file
4. You should now see an ICT indicator group with the indicator in there 

## Screenshots
### Menu
Note the only boxes you need to worry about are the rectangle color, transparency (100 being solid) and text color. I am not sure how to get rid of the other options.

### Macro Times
The text will only appear on 4 minute or less charts. Since they are short periods, the text doesn't look good untill 4 minutes or less.

### Silver Bullet
The text should be visible on 15 minute charts and above frames with enough zoom.

### Kill Zones
Text is same as silver bullet.
